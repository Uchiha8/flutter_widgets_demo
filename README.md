# WidgetsPractice Flutter Project

### Overview

This repository contains a Flutter project named "WidgetsPractice" that serves as a practical exploration of the concepts of Stateless and Stateful Widgets in Flutter. The project includes the implementation of both Stateless and Stateful Widgets, a widget tree with multiple levels, styling for enhanced visual appeal, and thorough testing.

### Project Structure

#### Flutter Project Creation:

A new Flutter project was initiated with the name "WidgetsPractice."
Stateless Widget:

A custom Stateless Widget, GreetingWidget, has been designed to display a greeting message. The message is passed as a parameter to the widget.
Using Stateless Widget:

The GreetingWidget is employed in the main function with various greeting messages to observe different results.
Stateful Widget:

A Stateful Widget, CounterWidget, has been crafted to display a counter. The counter starts at 0 and increments each time a button is pressed.
Using Stateful Widget:

The CounterWidget is integrated into the main function to test and demonstrate the counter functionality.
Widget Tree:

A widget tree has been constructed using both Stateless and Stateful Widgets, ensuring a minimum depth of three levels for a comprehensive understanding of widget composition.
Styling Widgets:

Different styles have been applied to widgets, including variations in text styles, padding, and margins, enhancing the visual aesthetics of the app.
Testing:

The app has been thoroughly tested on both emulators and real devices to ensure that all components function as expected.
